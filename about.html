                "Have you heard of the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV? With an expanded free trial which you can play through the entirety
                of A Realm Reborn and the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 for free with no restrictions on playtime." - Popular Copypasta
            </p>
            Final Fantasy 14, known commonly as <dfn>FFXIV</dfn>, is a subscription-based Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game <dfn>(MMORPG)</dfn> based on the lore and style of the Final Fantasy series.
            In the game, players can play as a variety of <dfn>Jobs</dfn> from different <dfn>Roles</dfn> (Tank, DPS, Healer), each with its unique playstyle and skillset.
            The game boasts an extensive story, and each patch updates the game with new <dfn>Main Story Quests</dfn> (MSQ). Through the MSQs, the game feels reminiscent of a traditional
            JRPG game.
            <br><br>
            In addition to MSQs, there are other means to enjoy the game. Interacting with fellow players throughout the expansive world, defeating open-world bosses, and the Casino are
            some ways players spend their time. Arguably one of the most popular game contents is the game's endgame content: <dfn>Savage and Ultimate raids</dfn>. These contents require
            high skill and coordinated teamwork, involving intricate puzzle-like mechanics in difficult boss battles. Both Savage and Ultimate raids are challenged with 8-man parties.
            Savage raids are considered difficult endgame content, and Ultimate raids are considered the most difficult, challenging battles available in the game.

            <p>A table describing each job can be found below, and more information can be found on the official <a href = "https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/jobguide/battle/" target="_blank">FFXIV Jobs page</a>.
                Jobs can be unlocked as the player pleases; players simply have to complete a small quest to unlock the prerequisite class, and at Level 30, can unlock the corresponding job. From then, players can
                complete content to level up the Job. 
                <br>
                In addition to the three main roles (Tank, Healer, DPS), there are <dfn>subroles</dfn> within the DPS role: <dfn>Melee</dfn>, <dfn>Physical Ranged</dfn>, and <dfn>Caster</dfn>.
                <br>
                <br><dfn>Melee</dfn> DPS generally have no cast-time associated with their skills, but must remain close to the enemy (in melee range). In exchange, Melee Jobs are capable of high damage.
                <br><dfn>Physical Ranged</dfn> Jobs can attack from a distance with no or few cast-times on their skills. Their range allows them to move and dodge enemy attacks more easily, in exchange for dealing less damage.
                <br><dfn>Casters</dfn> are also ranged, but have cast-time associated with their skills; while a skill is being casted, the player cannot move, or the skill will be canceled. Though they are the least mobile, Casters are
                 caoable of high damage in exchange.
                <b>Note:</b> Scholar and Summoner stem from the same base class, so when a player reaches Level 30 Arcanist, they are able to unlock both Scholar and Summoner. In addition, because they share the 
                same class, the two jobs share experience points (EXP) (if a player is gaining EXP on Summoner, the EXP will apply to Scholar as well).
